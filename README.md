Content Management System (CMS)

The Content Management System (CMS) is a web application built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Jinja2 templates. It allows users to manage a list of words and their translations along with example sentences. Users can view, add, edit, and paginate through the list of words. This project demonstrates the use of Flask for web development, SQLAlchemy for database management, and Jinja2 for templating.
